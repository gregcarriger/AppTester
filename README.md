# AppTester

PowerShell program to locally test software updates when the software runs in Windows Task Scheduler. I made this for a group with different security and permissions requirements.

This script was created to workaround Windows servers with PowerShell Remoting disabled.

## Step 1 - Run the program

Run AppLocalAnalyticsScript-Start.ps1 in a PowerShell prompt with `.\AppLocalAnalyticsScript-Start.ps1`
